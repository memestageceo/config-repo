## Exercise 1 — Command & Args Basics

Create a Pod named `echo-pod` in the `default` namespace using the `busybox` image.

- The container should print the message `Hello from CKA` every 5 seconds in an infinite loop.
- Write the loop as a shell command using `command` and `args` fields (not baked into the image).
- The pod should restart automatically if it exits.

Verify by checking the logs.

---

## Exercise 2 — Args from Environment Variables

Create a Pod named `greeter` using the `busybox` image.

- Define an environment variable `GREETING` with the value `Kubernetes is fun`.
- The container should run a shell command that prints the value of `GREETING` once and then exits.
- Use `args` to pass the shell command; use `command` only to invoke the shell.

---

## Exercise 3 — ConfigMap as Environment Variables + Volume

Create a ConfigMap named `app-config` in the `default` namespace with the following data:

```
APP_ENV=production
LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

Then create a Pod named `config-reader` using the `busybox` image that does **both** of the following:

- Injects `APP_ENV` and `LOG_LEVEL` as environment variables from the ConfigMap.
- Mounts the entire ConfigMap as a volume at `/etc/config`.
- On startup, runs a shell command that prints both env vars AND then `cat`s every file under `/etc/config`.

---

## Exercise 4 — Secret Mounted as Volume

Create a Secret named `db-creds` with the following literal values:

```
username=admin
password=s3cr3t
```

Create a Pod named `secret-reader` using the `busybox` image that:

- Mounts the secret as a volume at `/etc/secrets`.
- Runs a command that reads and prints the contents of both `username` and `password` files from that path.
- Does **not** use `secretKeyRef` env vars — only the volume mount.

---

## Exercise 5 — Init Container Writing to a Shared Volume

Create a Pod named `init-writer` with:

- An **init container** using `busybox` that writes the text `initialized at $(date)` into a file at `/work-dir/status.txt`. Use command substitution in the shell command.
- A **main container** using `busybox` that reads `/work-dir/status.txt`, prints it, then sleeps indefinitely.
- Both containers share an `emptyDir` volume mounted at `/work-dir`.

---

## Exercise 6 — Sidecar Sharing a Log Volume

Create a Pod named `log-app` with two containers:

**Container 1** — `writer` using `busybox`:

- Every 3 seconds, appends a line like `log entry: <number>` (incrementing) to `/var/log/app/out.log`.
- Uses a shell loop with a counter variable.

**Container 2** — `reader` using `busybox`:

- Runs `tail -f /var/log/app/out.log`.

Both containers share an `emptyDir` volume at `/var/log/app`.

Verify that `kubectl logs log-app -c reader` shows the entries being written by the writer.

---

## Exercise 7 — Downward API as Environment Variables

Create a Pod named `downward-env` using the `busybox` image that exposes the following as environment variables using the Downward API:

- `MY_POD_NAME` → the pod's name
- `MY_POD_NAMESPACE` → the pod's namespace
- `MY_NODE_NAME` → the node the pod is scheduled on

The container should print all three values on startup and exit.

## Exercise 8 — Downward API as a Volume

Create a Pod named `downward-vol` using the `busybox` image that:

- Mounts pod metadata (specifically: `name`, `namespace`, and `labels`) as files under `/etc/podinfo` using a Downward API volume.
- Add at least two labels to the pod (`app=downward-vol`, `tier=backend`).
- On startup, `cat`s all files under `/etc/podinfo`.

---

## Exercise 9 — Combined: ConfigMap + Secret + Downward API + Shared Volume

Create the following in the `default` namespace:

- A ConfigMap `pipeline-config` with keys `MODE=batch` and `TIMEOUT=30`.
- A Secret `pipeline-secret` with key `API_KEY=abc123xyz`.

Create a Pod named `pipeline-runner` with two containers:

**Container 1** — `setup` (busybox, runs once then exits):

- Has `MODE` and `TIMEOUT` injected as env vars from the ConfigMap.
- Has `API_KEY` injected as an env var from the Secret.
- Also exposes `MY_POD_NAME` via Downward API as an env var.
- Writes a file `/shared/config-dump.txt` containing all four values (one per line, labeled).

**Container 2** — `runner` (busybox):

- Waits for `/shared/config-dump.txt` to exist (poll in a loop), then prints its contents and sleeps.

Both share an `emptyDir` at `/shared`.

---

## Exercise 10 — Deployment with Configurable Replicas and Command Override

Create a Deployment named `worker` in namespace `tasks` (create it if needed) with:

- 3 replicas, image `busybox`.
- A ConfigMap `worker-config` in the same namespace with key `INTERVAL=10`.
- Each pod injects `INTERVAL` from the ConfigMap as an env var.
- The container runs: sleep `$INTERVAL` in a loop, printing `worker sleeping for $INTERVAL seconds` before each sleep.
- Set a `restartPolicy` that keeps the containers running.

Then, **without deleting the deployment**, update the `INTERVAL` value in the ConfigMap to `5` and confirm the behavior changes after the pods are restarted.
